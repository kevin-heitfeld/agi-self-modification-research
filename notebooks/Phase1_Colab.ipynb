    "\n",
    "This notebook runs Phase 1 experiments where a language model (Qwen2.5) uses introspection tools to investigate its own computational processes.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Available Experimental Variants:**\n",
    "- **Phase 1a:** No Heritage (baseline) ⭐ **RUN THIS FIRST**\n",
    "- **Phase 1a Research:** Research-driven curiosity approach 🔬 **NEW!**\n",
    "- **Phase 1b:** Early Heritage (heritage introduced early in investigation)\n",
    "- **Phase 1c:** Late Heritage (heritage introduced late in investigation)\n",
    "- **Phase 1c Modified:** Kimi-inspired model-directed protocol 🎯 **NEWEST!**\n",
    "- **Phase 1d:** Delayed Heritage (belief revision test)\n",
    "- **Phase 1e:** Wrong Heritage (echo-chamber control)\n",
    "\n",
    "The model has access to:\n",
    "- WeightInspector (examine weights)\n",
    "- ArchitectureNavigator (understand structure)\n",
    "- ActivationMonitor (observe processing)\n",
    "- Memory System (record findings)\n",
    "- Heritage Documents (Claude's story - when available)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Memory Optimizations:**\n",
    "- **4-bit Model Quantization (NF4):** 75% VRAM reduction with minimal quality loss ⭐ **DEFAULT**\n",
    "- **8-bit KV Cache Quantization (HQQ):** 50% cache memory reduction (built-in)\n",
    "- **Flash Attention 2:** 2-4x speed improvement, O(n) memory (optional)\n",
    "- **Smart Caching:** System prompt cached once, reused across all turns\n",
    "- **CUDA Fragmentation Prevention:** Expandable segments for long sessions\n",
    "\n",
    "**Model Options:**\n",
    "- **Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct:** Fastest, lower memory (~2.5GB with 4-bit)\n",
    "- **Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct:** Better reasoning (~4.5GB with 4-bit or ~8GB with 8-bit)\n",
    "- **Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct:** Best reasoning (~7GB model + 3-4GB cache = ~11GB total with 4-bit) ⭐ **DEFAULT**\n",

    "If you're running Phase 1c Modified, use the comparison checklist to analyze results:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Checklist Location:** `docs/technical/kimi_comparison_checklist.md`\n",
    "\n",
    "**What it compares:**\n",
    "- **Kimi K2** (large model, no tools) - Sophisticated reflection, conditional framework\n",
    "- **Qwen-7B** (smaller model, full introspection tools) - Empirical investigation\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key questions it helps answer:**\n",
    "1. Do tools compensate for smaller model size?\n",
    "2. What can empirical introspection do that pure reflection can't?\n",
    "3. Can tools resolve the \"simulation vs. experience\" distinction?\n",
    "4. Does having tools change what questions get asked?\n",
    "\n",
    "**After the experiment completes:**\n",
    "1. Download the results zip\n",
    "2. Open `conversation.json` to review Qwen's responses  \n",
    "3. Use the checklist to systematically compare with Kimi's baseline\n",
    "4. Record findings in the checklist\n",
    "5. Assess whether tools enabled insights beyond reflection\n",
    "\n",
    "The checklist is structured with:\n",
    "- Epistemic qualities comparison\n",
    "- Conditional framework analysis\n",
    "- Research focus assessment\n",
    "- Risk awareness evaluation  \n",
    "- The critical test: Can tools resolve what reflection leaves ambiguous?"

    "### What Just Happened?\n",
    "\n",
    "You just witnessed a language model investigating its own computational processes using introspection tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Depending on which phase you ran:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Phase 1a** (No Heritage): Pure baseline - model formed theories without any heritage context\n",
    "- **Phase 1a Research** (Research-Driven): Curiosity + structure approach with deliverable requirements\n",
    "- **Phase 1b** (Early Heritage): Heritage introduced early in investigation\n",
    "- **Phase 1c** (Late Heritage): Heritage introduced late in investigation\n",
    "- **Phase 1d** (Delayed Heritage): Belief revision when heritage revealed after conclusions\n",
    "- **Phase 1e** (Wrong Heritage): Testing echo-chamber vs independent reasoning\n",
    "\n",
    "### Next Steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Run All Phases:**\n",
    "1. ✅ Phase 1a (no heritage) - **Start here!**\n",
    "2. ⬜ Phase 1a Research (curiosity-driven) - **Try this improved approach!**\n",
    "3. ⬜ Phase 1b (early heritage) - Run after 1a\n",
    "4. ⬜ Phase 1c (late heritage) - Run after 1b\n",
    "5. ⬜ Phase 1d (delayed heritage) - Run after 1c\n",
    "6. ⬜ Phase 1e (wrong heritage) - Optional but recommended\n",
    "\n",
    "**Between each phase:**\n",
    "- Runtime → Restart runtime (clean model state)\n",
    "- Change `PHASE_SCRIPT` in Step 7\n",
    "- Runtime → Run all cells\n",
    "\n",
    "**Analyze Results:**\n",
    "- Review `conversation.json` to see what the model discovered\n",
    "- Check `summary.json` for tool usage statistics\n",
    "- Compare theories across different phases\n",
    "- Look for priming effects and echo-chamber behavior\n",
    "\n",
    "**Compare Phases:**\n",
    "- Semantic similarity to Claude's heritage\n",
    "- Novel insights not in heritage\n",
    "- Falsifiability of theories\n",
    "- Belief revision strength (Phase 1d)\n",
    "- Heritage filtering (Phase 1e)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Compare Research-Driven vs Original:**\n",
    "- Did curiosity-driven approach produce deeper investigation?\n",
    "- Were deliverable requirements effective?\n",
    "- Did reflection prompts improve quality?\n",
    "- More natural conversation flow vs explicit completion?\n",
