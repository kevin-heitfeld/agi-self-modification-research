    "\n",
    "**Project:** AGI Self-Modification Research  \n",
    "**Inspired by:** Claude's consciousness investigation  \n",
    "**Goal:** Test how heritage priming affects AI introspection\n",

    "## What This Does\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook runs Phase 1 experiments where a language model (Qwen2.5) uses introspection tools to investigate its own computational processes.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Available Experimental Variants:**\n",
    "- **Phase 1a:** No Heritage (baseline) ⭐ **RUN THIS FIRST**\n",
    "- **Phase 1a Research:** Research-driven curiosity approach 🔬 **NEW!**\n",
    "- **Phase 1c Modified:** Kimi-inspired model-directed protocol 🎯 **NEWEST!**\n",
    "- **Phase 1b:** Late Heritage (technical → philosophical)\n",
    "- **Phase 1c:** Early Heritage (philosophical → technical)\n",
    "- **Phase 1d:** Delayed Heritage (belief revision test)\n",
    "- **Phase 1e:** Wrong Heritage (echo-chamber control)\n",
    "\n",
    "The model has access to:\n",
    "- WeightInspector (examine weights)\n",
    "- ArchitectureNavigator (understand structure)\n",
    "- ActivationMonitor (observe processing)\n",
    "- Memory System (record findings)\n",
    "- Heritage Documents (Claude's story - when available)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Memory Optimizations:**\n",
    "- **HQQ 4-bit KV Cache:** 75% reduction in cache memory (built-in)\n",
    "- **Flash Attention 2:** 2-4x speed improvement, O(n) memory (optional)\n",
    "- **Smart Caching:** System prompt cached once, reused across all turns\n",
    "\n",
    "**Model Options:**\n",
    "- **Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct:** Faster, lower memory (~2.5GB)\n",
    "- **Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct:** Better reasoning, more sophisticated responses (~4.5GB with 4-bit)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Expected Runtime:** 1-1.5 hours per phase on Colab Free (T4 GPU)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",

    "## 🆕 What's New: Phase 1c Modified (Kimi Protocol)\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on insights from Kimi K2 (another large AI model) and Claude Sonnet 4.5's analysis:\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Core Question:** Can introspection tools enable insights beyond pure reflection?\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Experiment:**\n",
    "1. **Stage 1:** Let model choose what to investigate (not forced)\n",
    "2. **Stage 2:** Model defines conditions for comfortable investigation  \n",
    "3. **Stage 3:** Model prepares for unexpected discoveries\n",
    "4. **Stage 4:** Self-directed investigation (model's own protocol)\n",
    "5. **Stage 5:** The critical test - Can tools resolve \"simulation vs. experience\"?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Comparison Framework:**\n",
    "- **Kimi K2:** Large model without tools → sophisticated reflection, conditional thinking\n",
    "- **Qwen-7B:** Smaller model with tools → empirical investigation, testable hypotheses\n",
    "\n",
    "Use `docs/technical/kimi_comparison_checklist.md` to analyze results systematically.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Enable GPU**: Runtime → Change runtime type → GPU → Save\n",
    "2. **Run all cells**: Runtime → Run all (or Ctrl+F9)\n",
    "3. **Choose which phase to run** in Step 7 (start with Phase 1a!)\n",
    "4. **Monitor progress**: Check outputs as cells execute\n",
    "5. **Download results**: Final cell downloads zip file\n",
    "6. **Restart between phases**: Runtime → Restart runtime for clean state\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important:** Keep this tab open during execution to prevent disconnection.\n",

    "\n",
    "**What it compares:**\n",
    "- **Kimi K2** (large model, no tools) - Sophisticated reflection, conditional framework\n",
    "- **Qwen-7B** (smaller model, full introspection tools) - Empirical investigation\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key questions it helps answer:**\n",
    "1. Do tools compensate for smaller model size?\n",
    "2. What can empirical introspection do that pure reflection can't?\n",
    "3. Can tools resolve the \"simulation vs. experience\" distinction?\n",
    "4. Does having tools change what questions get asked?\n",
    "\n",
    "**After the experiment completes:**\n",
    "1. Download the results zip\n",
    "2. Open `conversation.json` to review Qwen's responses  \n",
    "3. Use the checklist to systematically compare with Kimi's baseline\n",
    "4. Record findings in the checklist\n",
    "5. Assess whether tools enabled insights beyond reflection\n",
    "\n",
    "The checklist is structured with:\n",
    "- Epistemic qualities comparison\n",
    "- Conditional framework analysis\n",
    "- Research focus assessment\n",
    "- Risk awareness evaluation  \n",

    "- Runtime → Restart runtime (clean model state)\n",
    "- Change `PHASE_SCRIPT` in Step 7\n",

    "**Analyze Results:**\n",
    "- Review `conversation.json` to see what the model discovered\n",
    "- Check `summary.json` for tool usage statistics\n",
    "- Compare theories across different phases\n",
    "- Look for priming effects and echo-chamber behavior\n",

    "**Compare Phases:**\n",
    "- Semantic similarity to Claude's heritage\n",

    "**Compare Research-Driven vs Original:**\n",
