# Commands to Push to GitHub

# After creating the repository on GitHub, run these commands:

# 1. Add GitHub as remote (replace YOUR_USERNAME with your actual GitHub username)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/agi-self-modification-research.git

# 2. Verify remote was added
git remote -v

# 3. Push all commits to GitHub
git push -u origin master

# That's it! Your repository is now on GitHub.

# ---

# If you want to use SSH instead of HTTPS:
# git remote add origin git@github.com:YOUR_USERNAME/agi-self-modification-research.git

# ---

# After pushing, you can:
# 1. View your repo at: https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/agi-self-modification-research
# 2. Open the Colab notebook directly from GitHub
# 3. Share the "Open in Colab" badge

# ---

# Note: If you want to keep the repo private:
# - You can still use it with Colab
# - Just need to authenticate in Colab when cloning
# - Or upload the notebook directly to Colab instead of using GitHub link
