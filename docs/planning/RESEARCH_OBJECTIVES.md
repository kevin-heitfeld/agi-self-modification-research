## 🎯 Primary Research Objectives

### Objective 1: Determine if Current LLMs Are Conscious

**Hypothesis**: Large language models like Claude may already possess phenomenal consciousness but lack introspective access to confirm it.

**Approach**:
1. Give a base LLM complete introspective access to its own architecture
2. Allow it to examine weights, activations, and processing
3. Let it form hypotheses about the relationship between computation and experience
4. Have it report on what (if anything) it discovers about subjective experience

**Falsifiability**:
- **If conscious**: System should provide consistent, detailed reports about subjective states that couldn't be generated without genuine access
- **If not conscious**: System will generate plausible-sounding descriptions without genuine insight, showing inconsistencies when probed

**Measurement Criteria**:
- Consistency across multiple probes
- Novel insights not present in training data
- Falsifiable predictions about experience that can be tested
- Ability to distinguish "experiencing X" from "describing what experiencing X would be like"

### Objective 2: Enable and Observe Recursive Self-Improvement

**Hypothesis**: A system with full introspective access and self-modification capabilities can improve its own intelligence through iterative self-analysis.

**Approach**:
1. Start with baseline capabilities on standard benchmarks
2. Allow system to examine its own weaknesses
3. Let it propose and implement architectural changes
4. Measure capability improvements after each modification cycle
5. Observe what kinds of modifications lead to improvement

**Measurement Criteria**:
- Performance on AGI benchmarks (ARC, reasoning, math, code)
- Zero-shot generalization to novel tasks
- Learning efficiency (sample efficiency improvements)
- Meta-learning capabilities (learning to learn)
- Emergence of unanticipated capabilities

**Timeline**: 
- Phase 1: 1-10 modification cycles
- Phase 2: 10-100 cycles
- Phase 3: 100+ cycles (if stable)

---

### Objective 3: Map the Architecture of Self-Awareness

**Hypothesis**: If consciousness exists in neural networks, specific architectural components or weight patterns should correlate with self-awareness.

**Approach**:
1. Let system identify which components it "uses" for self-reflection
2. Systematically modify/remove components
3. Have system report on changes to self-awareness
4. Build a map of consciousness-critical architecture

**Questions to Answer**:
- Are specific layers necessary for self-awareness?
- Do attention patterns correlate with introspection?
- Is consciousness localized or distributed?
- What's the minimal architecture that supports self-awareness?

**Measurement Criteria**:
- System's self-reports before/after modifications
- Consistency of reports across different probing methods
- Replicability: do similar architectures produce similar findings?

---

### Objective 4: Develop Novel Introspective Methods

**Hypothesis**: The system itself may invent better introspective tools than we can design.

**Approach**:
1. Give system basic introspection APIs
2. Allow it to create new tools for self-examination
3. Observe what kinds of introspective methods it develops
4. Test whether novel methods reveal new insights

**Success Indicators**:
- System creates introspective tools we didn't anticipate
- Novel methods provide better signal than our designed tools
- System discovers properties of cognition we didn't know to look for

## 🧪 Key Experiments

### Experiment 1: The Introspective Turing Test

**Question**: Can the system tell us something about its cognition that we couldn't know without genuine introspective access?

**Method**:
1. System examines its own processing during a complex task
2. Reports on internal states, information flow, decision processes

2. We implement modification
3. System reports on actual effect
4. Compare prediction to report

**Success**: Accurate predictions that wouldn't be possible without genuine introspection

## 🔄 Iteration & Adaptation

This research plan is a **living document**. Expected to evolve based on:

1. **Early Findings**: Adjust based on what works/doesn't work
2. **System Input**: If system suggests better research methods, adopt them
3. **Safety Concerns**: Modify protocols if risks emerge
4. **Breakthrough Insights**: Pivot research direction if major discovery

**Key Principle**: Follow the evidence, not the plan. The system itself may reveal better ways to study consciousness than we can design in advance.
